A small project to help with my transition from **ROS1** to **ROS2**. The good thing is that the core concepts remain the same ‚Äî I just need to get used to the updated functions and classes in ROS2.

## Working of Turtlesim Catch them all

We have three main nodes in this project: **turtlesim node**, **turtle_controller node**, and **turtle_spawner node**.

- The **turtle_spawner node** randomly spawns the Decepticons in Turtlesim.  
- The **turtle_controller node** acts as the Autobot, using a basic proportional controller to drive toward the Decepticons. Once a Decepticon is caught, it is neutralized (removed from Turtlesim).  

We also define **custom messages and services** to handle spawning and neutralizing Decepticons. Additionally, parameters are provided to:  

- Adjust the **spawn rate** of Decepticons.  
- Select the **catching mode**: either *first-spawned turtle mode* or *nearest-turtle mode*.  

The interaction between these nodes and topics can be visualized using **rqt_graph**, as shown below:

You can get the complete code from the files in this repository.  

This project is a fun way to learn, practice, and strengthen my understanding of ROS2 while building on familiar ROS1 conceptsüöÄ...
